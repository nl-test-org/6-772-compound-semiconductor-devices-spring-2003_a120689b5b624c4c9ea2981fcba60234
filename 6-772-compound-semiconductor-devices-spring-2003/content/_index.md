This course outlines the physics, modeling, application, and technology of compound semiconductors (primarily III-Vs) in electronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices and integrated circuits. Topics include: properties, preparation, and processing of compound semiconductors; theory and practice of heterojunctions, quantum structures, and pseudomorphic strained layers; metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs); heterojunction field effect transistors (HFETs) and bipolar transistors (HBTs); photodiodes, vertical-and in-plane-cavity laser diodes, and other optoelectronic devices.
